Going to integrate a few patches and fixes for skeinforge that are laying around the internet.

I am working on branch 'release' (skeinforge 50) for now.

Enrique Perez's Skeinforge, stashed in git.

For simplicity each version of Skeinforge is kept in its own branch, e.g.
sf-47, sf-50.

Patches to use Skeinforge with ReplicatorG are also kept in separate branches,
e.g. sf-47-RepG, sf-50-RepG.
